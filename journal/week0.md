# Week 0 â€” Billing and Architecture

1- I watched the tutorial videos.

- I spent some time watching tutorial videos to gain a better understanding of AWS and its services.
- I took notes on the key concepts and services covered in the videos to refer back to later.

2- I created a budget for my AWS account to help keep my expenses under control.

- I set up the budget in case my expenses exceed the limits.
- I set up two budgets: one for the free tier and one for the bootcamp budget.

- I set up alerts to notify me if my expenses reach certain thresholds, so I can take action to reduce my usage if necessary.
- I also set up an SNS topic to receive the alerts so that I can be notified via email or text message.


3- I generated access and secret keys for my AWS account so that I can use the AWS CLI to interact with my account.

- I generated the credentials and set up AWS CLI.
- I configured the AWS CLI with these credentials so that I can easily run commands from my local machine.

4- I spent some time researching the best practices for setting up a CI/CD pipeline on AWS.

- I created the CI/CD pipeline architecture diagram.
- I created a diagram that outlines the various components of the pipeline, including the source code repository, build server, testing environment, and deployment mechanism.
- I also made notes on how each component of the pipeline is connected and the dependencies between them.

5- I drew a diagram that outlines the architecture of the application that we'll to deploy on AWS.

- I created the application architecture diagram.
- I included details about the various components of the application, such as the front-end, back-end, and database.
- I also made notes about the technologies and services that will be used to build and deploy the application, as well as any potential scalability or performance considerations.
